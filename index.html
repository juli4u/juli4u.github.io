                        Created by the incarcerated Ross Ulbricht, founder of the notorious Silk Road marketplace, the "Perspective" NFT and its surrounding collection sparked both fascination and debate.  
                        For some, "Perspective" symbolizes Ulbricht's own experience, trapped within prison walls yet striving for hope and freedom. The upward gaze echoes a yearning for a brighter future, perhaps mirroring Ulbricht's ongoing legal appeals and fight for clemency.

                        The meaning of "The Goose" specifically is open to interpretation, as with most abstract art. 
                        Some viewers might find the concentric circles mesmerizing or meditative, while others might see them as symbolic of growth, expansion, or infinity. 
                        The title "The Goose" could add another layer of meaning, potentially evoking associations with flight, freedom, or even silliness. 
                        Ultimately, the meaning of the artwork is up to the individual viewer to decide

                        CryptoPunk #8857, one of the 10,000 unique pixel art characters created by Larva Labs in 2017. 
                        It depicts a male punk with wild, spiky hair and 3D glasses, making it one of the 88 zombie punks in the collection. 
                        The pixelated style and unconventional appearance of the punk could be seen as a rejection of mainstream ideals and a celebration of nonconformity. 
                        The 3D glasses, a hallmark of CryptoPunks, could be interpreted as a nod to the increasing role of technology in our lives and the blurring lines between the physical and digital worlds.

                        Its crimson hue, a timeless emblem of love and passion, stands in stark contrast to the void-like black, amplifying the intensity and permanence of affection's grip. 
                        Abosch invites viewers to contemplate the nature of love, prompting questions of whether its essence, like the artwork itself, can truly ever fade.
